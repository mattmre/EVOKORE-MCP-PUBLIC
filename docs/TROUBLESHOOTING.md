# EVOKORE-MCP Troubleshooting Guide

If EVOKORE-MCP is failing to connect or crashing, or you are seeing surprising behavior from a hook, child server, voice path, or discovery mode, work through the entries on this page in order. The entries are independent and each one names symptoms, cause, and the smallest fix you can apply.

## What this covers

- Connection, skill index, and Windows-specific child-server failures
- Voice sidecar and hook observability
- HITL approval retries, dynamic discovery surprises, and benchmark artifacts
- `repo:audit` and post-merge cleanup gotchas
- Where to find skill documentation when search comes back empty

## 1. Connection Closed Error (`MCP error -32000`)
**Symptoms:** You add the server via `gemini mcp add`, but when you check `/mcp ls`, the server displays a red dot with `Disconnected`.
**Cause:** The TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) outputs the compiled file to a location that your configuration is not expecting, or the Node script crashed on startup (e.g., trying to read a directory that doesn't exist).
**Solution:**
Ensure you are pointing the command to `dist/index.js` (the compiled runtime entrypoint).
```bash
# Correct
gemini mcp add evokore-mcp node /path/to/EVOKORE-MCP/dist/index.js
```

## 2. "ENOENT: no such file or directory, scandir '.../SKILLS'"
**Symptoms:** The Node process crashes immediately with an `ENOENT` error targeting the `SKILLS` folder.
**Cause:** The script used `process.cwd()` instead of `__dirname` to resolve the `SKILLS` path, so it looked for the folder in the terminal's active directory instead of the repository's directory.
**Solution:**
This has been fixed in `v1.1.0`. Ensure you have pulled the latest `main` branch. The code must use `path.resolve(__dirname, "../SKILLS")`.

## 3. Skills Not Showing in `search_skills`
**Symptoms:** The MCP server connects, but when you ask the AI to search for a skill, it returns "No skills found."
**Cause:** The YAML frontmatter inside the `.md` file is missing or malformed, causing the parser to fail.
**Solution:**
Run the normalization script:
```bash
node scripts/clean_skills.js
```
This script traverses the `SKILLS/` directory and auto-repairs any broken Markdown headers. Restart your MCP connection (`/mcp refresh`) after running the script.

## 4. Debugging the Connection
If the server still won't connect, launch your AI assistant in debug mode to see the `stderr` output.
- **Gemini CLI:** Launch the CLI with `gemini --debug`, or press `F12` during an interactive session to open the debug console.
- **Claude Desktop:** Check the `mcp.log` file (Location varies by OS; on Windows it is usually `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp.log`).

## 5. Voice Sidecar Not Speaking
**Symptoms:** Claude hook runs, but no audio is played.
**Checks:**
- Ensure the sidecar is running: `npm run voice`
- Verify your `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` is set
- If you intentionally want silent validation or artifact-only runs, set `VOICE_SIDECAR_DISABLE_PLAYBACK=1`
- To preserve generated audio for inspection, set `VOICE_SIDECAR_ARTIFACT_DIR=/absolute/path` and check the logged saved path
- If you expected a non-default persona, set `VOICE_SIDECAR_PERSONA=<persona>` on the hook or include `persona` / `metadata.persona` in the hook payload
- Validate hook and payload behavior with:
  - `npx vitest run test-voice-e2e-validation.js`
  - `npx vitest run test-voice-refinement-validation.js`

**Optional live ElevenLabs validation:**

```bash
EVOKORE_RUN_LIVE_VOICE_TEST=1 ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_key_here npm run test:voice:live
```

If `EVOKORE_RUN_LIVE_VOICE_TEST` is not set to `1`, the live validation skips intentionally. If you enable the gate without providing `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` through your shell environment or `.env`, the test fails fast so local and CI runs do not silently pass with a misconfigured live check.

## 6. Release Workflow Did Not Publish
**Symptoms:** Release workflow runs but package is not published.
**Cause:** `NPM_TOKEN` secret is missing or invalid.
**Solution:**
- Add/update `NPM_TOKEN` in repository secrets.
- Re-run via `workflow_dispatch`.
- Confirm workflow checks with `npm run release:check`.
- Treat GitHub release publication and npm publication as separate gates: a GitHub release can succeed while npm publish is skipped.

## 7. VoiceMode Fails to Start on Windows
**Symptoms:** `converse` fails immediately, or VoiceMode does not detect your API key.
**Common causes:**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` was set in one shell, but Claude Code was started from another shell/session.
- `uvx` is not available in the shell PATH used to register/run VoiceMode.

**Solution (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# Persist for future terminals
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "sk-your-key-here"

# Set for current shell before starting Claude Code
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-your-key-here"

# Confirm uvx is available
uvx --version
```

Then restart Claude Code and retry `converse`.

## 8. Duplicate Proxied Tool Name Warning
**Symptoms:** Startup logs include a warning like `Skipping duplicate proxied tool 'server_tool' from server 'server' (already registered).`
**Cause:** Two registrations produced the same prefixed name (`${serverId}_${tool.name}`).
**Solution:** EVOKORE keeps the first tool registration and skips duplicates by design. Rename one upstream tool or adjust server IDs if you need both tools exposed.

If you want a live registry snapshot after startup, call `proxy_server_status`.

## 9. Child Server Fails with Unresolved Env Placeholder
**Symptoms:** Startup logs include an error like `Unresolved env placeholder(s) for child server 'elevenlabs' key 'ELEVENLABS_API_KEY': ${ELEVENLABS_API_KEY}` followed by `Failed to boot child server ...`.
**Cause:** A `${VAR_NAME}` placeholder in `mcp.config.json` referenced an environment variable that is not set in the process launching EVOKORE.
**Solution:**
- Set the missing environment variable(s) before starting EVOKORE (for example, `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`).
- Confirm values are available in the same shell/session used to start your MCP host.
- Restart EVOKORE after updating env vars.

Disabled child servers are skipped before placeholder resolution. If you want an optional local integration to stay dormant until the machine-specific paths are ready, leave `"disabled": true`.

## 10. HITL Token Retry Keeps Failing (`_evokore_approval_token`)
**Symptoms:** You retry a `require_approval` tool call and still get the security interceptor error.

**Checks:**
- Use the token only once (replay attempts fail by design).
- Retry with the exact same arguments as the intercepted call.
- Retry promptly; tokens are short-lived (around 5 minutes) and can expire.

**Retry workflow:**
1. Run tool call without token and capture the returned `_evokore_approval_token`.
2. Ask for explicit user approval.
3. Retry the same tool call with unchanged arguments plus `_evokore_approval_token`.
4. If that retry fails, run the original call again to get a fresh token and repeat.

## 11. Inspecting Hook Observability Logs
**Symptoms:** You need to confirm whether hooks are allowing/blocking as expected without changing existing hook output behavior.

**Location:** `~/.evokore/logs/hooks.jsonl`

**Schema quick reference:**

- `ts` (ISO timestamp)
- `hook` (for example `damage-control`, `purpose-gate`, `session-replay`, `tilldone`)
- `event` (hook-specific event label)
- `session_id` (optional, sanitized)
- hook-specific fields (for example `tool`, `reason`, `mode`, `incomplete_count`)

**PowerShell checks:**
```powershell
# Last 50 events
Get-Content "$HOME\.evokore\logs\hooks.jsonl" -Tail 50

# Parse and inspect only tilldone hook events
Get-Content "$HOME\.evokore\logs\hooks.jsonl" |
  ForEach-Object { $_ | ConvertFrom-Json } |
  Where-Object { $_.hook -eq "tilldone" }
```

## 12. Windows Command Boot Fails for Child Servers
**Symptoms:** Child server boot fails on Windows when using `uv` or `uvx`, even though `npx`-based servers work.

**Cause:** EVOKORE remaps only `npx` to `npx.cmd` on Windows. It does not rewrite `uv` or `uvx` command names.

**Solution:**
- Verify `uv --version` and `uvx --version` in the same shell used to launch your MCP host.
- Ensure the configured command in `mcp.config.json` matches a command available on PATH.
- Use `npx`-based child configs only when that command is intentionally required.

If you are booting local reverse-engineering child servers, also verify the resolved Python interpreter path and repo working directory:

- `EVOKORE_RE_GHIDRA_HEADLESS_PYTHON` + `EVOKORE_RE_GHIDRA_HEADLESS_REPO`
- `EVOKORE_RE_REVA_PYTHON` + `EVOKORE_RE_REVA_REPO`
- `EVOKORE_RE_BINARY_MCP_PYTHON` + `EVOKORE_RE_BINARY_MCP_REPO`

EVOKORE now passes the configured `cwd` through to stdio child launches, so a bad repo path can break `python -m ...` startup even when the interpreter path is valid.

## 13. CI Fails on Submodule Cleanliness Validation
**Symptoms:** CI fails on `node scripts/validate-submodule-cleanliness.js`.

**Common causes by marker/state:**
- `-` uninitialized submodule
- `+` submodule commit mismatch (worktree commit differs from parent gitlink)
- `U` submodule merge conflict
- non-empty submodule `git status --porcelain` output (dirty submodule worktree)

**Solution:**
1. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
2. Run `git submodule status --recursive` and verify no unexpected mismatch/conflict states.
3. Commit inside the submodule first when needed.
4. Commit the updated submodule pointer in this parent repo.
5. Re-run `node scripts/validate-submodule-cleanliness.js` before pushing.

## 14. Dynamic Mode Looks Like It Is Missing Proxy Tools
**Symptoms:** With `EVOKORE_TOOL_DISCOVERY_MODE=dynamic`, `tools/list` only shows the native EVOKORE tools.

**Cause:** This is the intended MVP contract. Dynamic mode starts with always-visible native tools and adds proxied tools only after discovery for the current session.

**Solution:**
- Call `discover_tools` with a natural-language query or the exact prefixed tool name.
- Re-run `tools/list` if your client does not refresh automatically after `tools/list_changed`.
- If needed, call a proxied tool directly by exact name; hidden/unlisted proxied tools remain callable for compatibility.

## 15. Dynamic Discovery Does Not Look Session-Isolated
**Symptoms:** Tool activations appear to persist across a long-running stdio session, or you expected separate activation sets without seeing them.

**Cause:** The current EVOKORE runtime is stdio-first. When the transport does not provide a session ID, EVOKORE uses the default key `__stdio_default_session__`, so discovery state is effectively connection-scoped.

**Solution:**
- Treat one stdio connection as one discovery session.
- Restart or reconnect the client if you want a clean activation set in stdio mode.
- For true multi-session isolation, use a transport/runtime that provides distinct session IDs.

## 16. Discovery Benchmark Artifact Was Not Saved
**Symptoms:** `npm run benchmark:tool-discovery` prints JSON, but you expected a file artifact too.

**Cause:** File capture is opt-in. By default, the benchmark writes JSON to stdout only.

**Solution:**
- Pass `--output <path>` to save the same JSON artifact to disk.
- Ensure the parent directory is writable.

Example:
```bash
node scripts/benchmark-tool-discovery.js --output artifacts/tool-discovery-benchmark.json
```

## 17. `repo:audit` Reports Control-Plane Drift
**Symptoms:** `npm run repo:audit` reports modified or untracked control-plane files even though code/runtime state looks clean.
**Cause:** In this repo, the handoff surface is intentionally local-first. Operator-facing context files, session notes, and planning artifacts may drift during an in-progress session without implying runtime breakage.
**Solution:**
- Confirm whether the drift is expected handoff work or unexpected noise.
- If you are resuming repo work, read the listed control-plane files before changing branches.
- If you are finishing a session, update the handoff docs and then rerun:
  ```bash
  npm run repo:audit -- --json
  ```
- Treat stale branch/worktree candidates as cleanup items. Treat control-plane drift as documentation state unless it conflicts with the live repo state.

## 18. Remote Branch Cleanup Fails After A Merge Wave
**Symptoms:** `git push origin --delete ...` fails for some merged PR branches with `remote ref does not exist`.
**Cause:** GitHub may have already auto-deleted the merged PR head branches.
**Solution:**
```bash
git fetch --prune origin
git branch -r
```

Then delete only the still-present remote branches that remain explicitly accounted for. Do not treat the initial failure as evidence of a repo problem by itself.

## 19. Where Do I Find Skill Documentation?
**Symptoms:** You know there is a skill for what you want to do but cannot remember its exact name or category.
**Solution:**
- Generate the wiki locally with `npm run wiki:build` and open `docs/wiki/skills-index.html` in any browser. Each skill has a self-contained page under `docs/wiki/skills/<category-slug>/<skill-slug>.html`, and per-category indexes live under `docs/wiki/categories/`. The wiki is a build artifact and is not committed to the repository.
- For a fast flat lookup, scan [`ALL_SKILLS_CRIB_SHEET.md`](./ALL_SKILLS_CRIB_SHEET.md).
- For a higher-level narrative grouped by category, read [`SKILLS_OVERVIEW.md`](./SKILLS_OVERVIEW.md).
- For natural-language discovery from inside an MCP client, call `resolve_workflow` with your intent or `search_skills` with a keyword.
