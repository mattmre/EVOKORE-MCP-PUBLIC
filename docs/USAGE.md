# EVOKORE-MCP Usage Guide

This guide covers how to connect EVOKORE-MCP to your AI client, use the built-in tools, tune discovery and pagination, run the operator preflight before a work session, configure HITL approvals, wire the voice sidecar, view hook observability output, and tour the platform modules (HTTP, OAuth, sessions, RBAC, webhooks, plugins) that round out the day-to-day operator surface.

## What this covers

- Connecting EVOKORE to one or more AI clients
- The built-in tools and how to use discovery mode and `tools/list` pagination
- HITL approval token flow
- Operator preflight, workflow adoption, and Windows command behavior
- The skill ecosystem (versioning, registries, sandbox, hot-reload)
- Rate limiting, the session dashboard, voice integration, hook observability
- Pointers into the HTTP/OAuth/session/RBAC/webhook/plugin guides

## 1. Connecting to an AI Assistant

EVOKORE-MCP uses the standard Model Context Protocol via `stdio`. You must point your AI client to the compiled `index.js` file.

### For Gemini CLI
To register this server globally so it's available in any project:
```bash
gemini mcp add evokore-mcp node /absolute/path/to/EVOKORE-MCP/dist/index.js --scope user
```
After running this, type `/mcp` in your interactive session to confirm it is `CONNECTED`.

### For Claude Desktop
Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "evokore-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/EVOKORE-MCP/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### For Cursor IDE
1. Open Cursor Settings.
2. Go to **Features > MCP Servers**.
3. Add a new server. Name it `evokore-mcp`.
4. Command: `node /absolute/path/to/EVOKORE-MCP/dist/index.js`.

### Multi-IDE Setup (Cursor, Windsurf, Continue)

EVOKORE-MCP ships template-based configs for third-party IDEs under `configs/cross-ide/`. The same `evokore-mcp` server binary is wired into each IDE — only the config file location and schema differ.

Use the `--target` flag on `scripts/sync-configs.js` to generate and install the IDE-specific config automatically:

```bash
# Cursor  → ~/.cursor/mcp.json
node scripts/sync-configs.js --target cursor --dry-run
node scripts/sync-configs.js --target cursor --apply

# Windsurf (Codeium) → ~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json
node scripts/sync-configs.js --target windsurf --dry-run
node scripts/sync-configs.js --target windsurf --apply

# Continue (VS Code / JetBrains extension) → ~/.continue/config.json
node scripts/sync-configs.js --target continue --dry-run
node scripts/sync-configs.js --target continue --apply
```

**How it works:**

- The script reads the template at `configs/cross-ide/<target>.json`.
- `${EVOKORE_INSTALL_DIR}` is substituted with the canonical git root (same resolution as the Claude sync path).
- For Cursor and Windsurf, the `mcpServers.evokore-mcp` entry is merged into any existing config (other servers are preserved).
- For Continue, the entry is appended to the `mcpServers` array (any prior `evokore-mcp` entry is replaced, not duplicated).
- `--dry-run` prints the resolved config and the target path without touching disk. `--apply` writes the file (creating parent directories as needed).

**Config file locations at a glance:**

| IDE | Config file | Schema |
|---|---|---|
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` | `mcpServers` object, keyed by server name |
| Windsurf | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` | `mcpServers` object, keyed by server name |
| Continue | `~/.continue/config.json` | `mcpServers` array of named entries |

Unknown targets exit with a non-zero status and print the supported list.

## 2. Using the Built-In Tools

Once connected, your AI assistant will automatically have access to the following tools:

- **`search_skills`**: Ask the AI to find a specific workflow. The search index now uses skill names, descriptions, directory taxonomy, tags, selected frontmatter metadata, and semantic hint extraction so natural-language objectives like "wrap up session handoff" resolve more reliably. (e.g., *"Search the MCP for React styling skills."*)
- **`get_skill_help`**: If you want to know what a specific skill does, ask the AI to explain it. (e.g., *"What does the 'arch-aep-runner' skill do? Show me some examples."*)
- **`discover_tools`**: Search the merged EVOKORE catalog of native and proxied tools. In `dynamic` mode, matching proxied tools become visible for the current session.
- **`proxy_server_status`**: Inspect the aggregated child-server registry, including server status, connection type, error counts, registered tool counts, and last-seen timestamps.
- **`refresh_skills`**: Rescan the `SKILLS/` directory and rebuild the skill index. Use this after adding or modifying skill files during a live session. An optional filesystem watcher can be enabled via `EVOKORE_SKILL_WATCHER=true` for automatic hot-reload.
- **`fetch_skill`**: Download a skill from a remote URL (GitHub raw content, HTTP endpoint) and install it locally in the `SKILLS/` directory.
- **`list_registry`**: List available skills from configured remote skill registries. Registries are defined in `mcp.config.json` under `skillRegistries`.
- **`execute_skill`**: Execute code blocks extracted from a skill file in a sandboxed subprocess. Supports `bash`, `js`, `python`, and `ts` with a 30-second timeout and 1 MB output limit.

When `get_skill_help` is invoked, EVOKORE-MCP returns the raw Markdown instructions to the LLM, enabling the LLM to understand exactly what the skill is capable of and explain it to you in plain English.

### 2.1 Tool discovery mode (`EVOKORE_TOOL_DISCOVERY_MODE`)

EVOKORE supports two tool-listing modes:

- **`dynamic`** (default): `tools/list` returns the always-visible native tools plus only the proxied tools activated during the current session. Yields a lean ~1.5-2.5K-token initial payload.
- **`legacy`** (opt-out): every `tools/list` returns the full native + proxied tool list, including `discover_tools`. Yields a ~12-31K-token payload.

```bash
# Default behavior — no env var needed:
node dist/index.js

# Opt out to legacy full-list mode:
EVOKORE_TOOL_DISCOVERY_MODE=legacy node dist/index.js
```

`EVOKORE_TOOL_DISCOVERY_MODE=legacy` is also a hard safety pin: it overrides any `EVOKORE_DISCOVERY_PROFILE` selection and forces the built-in default profile (every native tool always visible).

In `dynamic` mode:

1. Call `discover_tools` with a natural-language query or exact tool name.
2. Matching proxied tools are activated for the current session.
3. EVOKORE emits `sendToolListChanged()` on a best-effort basis.
4. Re-run `tools/list` if your client does not auto-refresh.

Hidden proxied tools remain callable by exact prefixed name for compatibility, even when they are not currently listed.

For the current stdio runtime, EVOKORE uses a default session key when the transport does not provide a real `sessionId`. In practice, that means one long-lived stdio connection behaves like one discovery session. Session isolation becomes multi-session only on transports that attach distinct session IDs.

### 2.1.1 `tools/list` cursor pagination

EVOKORE supports MCP opaque-cursor pagination for `tools/list`, but it is **off by default** to preserve single-call behavior for clients that do not follow `nextCursor`.

Pagination activates when *either*:

1. **The client sends a `cursor` param** — signaling cursor support. The handler returns a page and a `nextCursor` for the rest of the catalog.
2. **The operator opts in via `EVOKORE_TOOL_LIST_PAGINATION=on`** — the first response is also paged, useful for clients that cap visible tools at a low number and do not yet send a cursor on the initial probe.

If neither condition is met, the handler returns the full tool array with no `nextCursor`.

- **Default page size:** `35` (chosen for headroom under common client tool caps).
- **Configure page size:** `EVOKORE_TOOL_LIST_PAGE_SIZE=<n>` — clamped to `[1, 1000]`.
- **Force pagination on:** `EVOKORE_TOOL_LIST_PAGINATION=on` — useful when you want capped clients to immediately see a paged response without waiting for them to send a cursor.
- **Cursor invalidation:** every `tools/list_changed` notification bumps an internal epoch. Cursors issued before the bump decode to a *graceful first-page reset* rather than an error.

```bash
# Force pagination on with a custom page size:
EVOKORE_TOOL_LIST_PAGINATION=on EVOKORE_TOOL_LIST_PAGE_SIZE=50 node dist/index.js
```

### 2.2 Benchmarking tool discovery

Use the benchmark script to capture a deterministic JSON snapshot of the discovery/listing contract:

```bash
npm run benchmark:tool-discovery
```

The default JSON payload is deterministic across repeated runs: it captures the discovery/listing contract, stable token-size estimates, and top matches while omitting machine-specific timing telemetry. To preserve the same artifact on disk, pass `--output <path>`:

```bash
node scripts/benchmark-tool-discovery.js --output artifacts/tool-discovery-benchmark.json
```

The output file contains the exact same JSON document emitted to stdout.

If you also want live timing telemetry for a one-off local benchmark, pass `--live-timings`. That mode adds a non-deterministic `liveTimings` block and is intended for manual inspection rather than durable artifact comparison.

### 2.3 HITL approval token (`_evokore_approval_token`)

For tools configured as `require_approval`, EVOKORE returns a security-intercept error first, then includes a `_evokore_approval_token` for the retry.

- Tokens are **one-time use**. A replayed token is rejected.
- Tokens are bound to the **exact same tool arguments**. If any argument changes, the token is rejected.
- Tokens are **short-lived** (current implementation target: about 5 minutes). If you wait too long, expect expiry and request a fresh token.
- Proxied tools advertise `_evokore_approval_token` as an optional schema field even when the upstream tool declares no input properties.
- Retry workflow: ask for explicit approval -> rerun the same tool call -> include `_evokore_approval_token` exactly as returned.

## 2.4 Operator preflight before a new work session

If you are about to start a new implementation slice, cleanup wave, or repo review session, run:

```bash
npm run repo:audit
```

This is the quickest way to answer:

- am I on the right branch?
- is `main` ahead of my current work?
- are there stale worktrees or stale local branches?
- are there merged remote branches that should be accounted for?
- is my control plane (operator-facing context, session notes, planning files) drifting from repo state?

For machine-readable output:

```bash
npm run repo:audit -- --json
```

In the normal repo-maintenance loop, the recommended order is:

1. `npm run repo:audit`
2. review branch / PR state
3. run the smallest targeted validation for your subsystem
4. run `npm test` for broad changes
5. update continuity artifacts (session log, planning files, and any in-repo operator notes) if the execution state changed

## 3. Adopting a Workflow

EVOKORE-MCP exposes skills through tools like `search_skills`, `get_skill_help`, and `resolve_workflow`.
*"Adopt the `session-wrap` workflow."* -> The AI can discover the skill and load its canonical instructions through these tools before executing the workflow.

`resolve_workflow` also explains why a workflow matched, which helps operators verify that the injected skill aligns with the requested objective.

When EVOKORE proxies child MCP servers, tool names use the prefixed tool name format `${serverId}_${tool.name}`. If the same prefixed name appears more than once, EVOKORE keeps the first registration, skips later duplicates, and logs a warning.

Child server env values in `mcp.config.json` can reference placeholders like `${ELEVENLABS_API_KEY}`. If any placeholder is unresolved at startup, EVOKORE fails fast for that child server and logs an explicit error instead of silently substituting an empty value. Other child servers continue booting.

Child server `command`, `args`, `cwd`, and `url` fields use the same `${VAR_NAME}` interpolation rules. This is what allows local Python-backed MCP repos such as `ghidra_headless`, `reva`, and `binary_analysis` to live in the shared config without hardcoding workstation-specific paths.

If a child server entry is marked with `"disabled": true`, EVOKORE skips it before any placeholder resolution or process spawn happens. This is the intended pattern for optional workstation-specific integrations.

### 3.1 PR governance metadata for process/tooling/release changes

For process/tooling/release-impacting changes, use `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.

Required sections include:

- Description
- Type of Change
- Changes Made
- Skills/Tools Affected
- Testing
- Evidence

### 3.2 Windows command resolution behavior

On Windows, EVOKORE runtime command resolution remaps **only** `npx` to `npx.cmd`.

- `uv` and `uvx` are **not** remapped to `.cmd` by EVOKORE.
- Ensure your shell PATH can resolve `uv --version` / `uvx --version` directly when used in child-server configs.

## 4. Skill Ecosystem

### 4.1 Skill versioning

Skills can declare optional versioning metadata in their YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
version: 1.2.0
requires:
  - core-utils@>=1.0.0
conflicts:
  - legacy-helper
---
```

- `version`: semver string for the skill
- `requires`: list of skill dependencies with optional version constraints
- `conflicts`: list of skill names that are incompatible

EVOKORE validates dependencies at load time via `validateDependencies()`. Unsatisfied requirements are reported but do not block skill loading.

### 4.2 Remote skill registries

Configure registries in `mcp.config.json`:

```json
{
  "skillRegistries": [
    {
      "name": "example",
      "baseUrl": "https://example.com/skills",
      "index": "registry.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

Use the `list_registry` tool to browse available remote skills, and `fetch_skill` to download and install them locally.

### 4.3 Skill execution sandbox

The `execute_skill` tool extracts fenced code blocks from a skill file and runs them in a sandboxed child process:

- Supported languages: `bash`, `js`, `python`, `ts`
- Timeout: 30 seconds per execution
- Output limit: 1 MB
- Isolation: runs in a subprocess, not in the MCP server process
- Container mode uses the global `EVOKORE_SANDBOX_MEMORY_MB` / `EVOKORE_SANDBOX_CPU_LIMIT`
  baseline plus optional per-language overrides for `bash`, `javascript`, `typescript`,
  and `python`

Example usage through your AI client: *"Execute the setup steps from the 'project-bootstrap' skill."*

### 4.4 Skill hot-reload

Two mechanisms for refreshing the skill index:

1. **Manual**: call `refresh_skills` to trigger an immediate rescan of `SKILLS/`
2. **Automatic**: set `EVOKORE_SKILL_WATCHER=true` to enable a filesystem watcher that auto-refreshes when skill files change

## 5. Rate Limiting

EVOKORE supports configurable rate limits per server and per tool via `mcp.config.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "rateLimit": {
        "maxTokens": 10,
        "refillRate": 2,
        "refillIntervalMs": 1000
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- **Algorithm**: token bucket
- **`maxTokens`**: maximum burst capacity
- **`refillRate`**: tokens added per interval
- **`refillIntervalMs`**: interval in milliseconds between refills
- Rate limiting is separate from the error-triggered cooldown mechanism

When a tool call is rate-limited, EVOKORE returns an error instructing the client to retry after a short delay.

## 6. Session Dashboard

Launch the zero-dependency session dashboard:

```bash
npm run dashboard
```

The dashboard runs on `127.0.0.1:8899` and provides:

- Session replay viewer (reads `~/.evokore/sessions/*-replay.jsonl`)
- Evidence log viewer (reads `~/.evokore/sessions/*-evidence.jsonl`)
- HITL approval UI at `/approvals` (reads/writes `~/.evokore/pending-approvals.json`)

The approval page shows pending approval tokens with deny buttons, allowing operators to review and reject HITL approval requests from a browser.

## 7. Voice Integration

EVOKORE-MCP supports voice input/output through two complementary systems:

### ElevenLabs MCP (TTS - Voice Output)

ElevenLabs is proxied as a child server through EVOKORE-MCP, giving all connected AI clients access to high-quality text-to-speech, voice cloning, and audio tools.

**Setup:**

1. Get your API key from https://elevenlabs.io/app/developers/api-keys (10k free credits/month)
2. Add it to your `.env` file:
   ```
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```
3. Install `uv` if not already installed: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
4. Restart EVOKORE-MCP. The `elevenlabs_*` tools will appear automatically.

**Available tools** (prefixed with `elevenlabs_`): text-to-speech generation, voice cloning, audio transcription, voice design, audio isolation, and soundscape creation.

**Output modes** (set via `ELEVENLABS_MCP_OUTPUT_MODE` in `mcp.config.json`):
- `files` - saves audio to disk (default: ~/Desktop)
- `resources` - returns base64-encoded audio in MCP responses
- `both` - saves to disk and returns base64

### VoiceMode (STT + TTS - Bidirectional Voice)

VoiceMode adds voice conversations directly to Claude Code via MCP. Speak naturally and hear responses.

**Setup:**

```bash
# Add to Claude Code (user scope - already done if using EVOKORE-MCP setup)
claude mcp add --scope user voicemode -- uvx --refresh voice-mode

# Set your OpenAI API key for Whisper STT + TTS
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"
```

**Windows setup notes (PowerShell):**

```powershell
# Persist for future terminals
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "sk-your-key-here"

# Also set for the current session before launching Claude Code
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-your-key-here"
```

If `uvx` is not on PATH in Windows shells, retry the registration command from a shell where `uvx --version` succeeds.

**Usage:** Type `converse` in Claude Code to start a voice conversation.

**Configuration (environment variables):**
- `VOICEMODE_TTS_SPEED=1.2` - Adjust speech speed
- `VOICEMODE_VOICES=nova,shimmer` - Choose TTS voices

**Local/offline mode:** Install Whisper.cpp (STT) and Kokoro (TTS) for fully local voice with no cloud dependencies. VoiceMode auto-detects local services.

### Local TTS (OpenAI-Compatible)

VoiceSidecar supports any OpenAI-compatible TTS endpoint as an alternative to ElevenLabs. This enables fully local, offline text-to-speech via projects like [Kokoro-FastAPI](https://github.com/remsky/Kokoro-FastAPI) or [Chatterbox TTS API](https://github.com/travisvn/chatterbox-tts-api).

**Setup:**

1. Run a local TTS server (example with Kokoro-FastAPI):
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8880:8880 ghcr.io/remsky/kokoro-fastapi:latest
   ```

2. Configure VoiceSidecar to use it:
   ```bash
   export EVOKORE_TTS_PROVIDER=openai-compat
   export EVOKORE_TTS_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8880
   # No API key needed for local servers
   ```

3. Start VoiceSidecar as usual — it will POST to `${EVOKORE_TTS_BASE_URL}/v1/audio/speech` instead of connecting to ElevenLabs.

**Voice mapping:** Each persona in `voices.json` has an `openaiVoice` field that maps to a voice name on your local server. The default voice can also be set via `EVOKORE_TTS_VOICE`.

**Supported local TTS servers:**
- [Kokoro-FastAPI](https://github.com/remsky/Kokoro-FastAPI) — 82M params, 35-100x realtime, Docker ready
- [Chatterbox TTS API](https://github.com/travisvn/chatterbox-tts-api) — Voice cloning, 23 languages, OpenAI-compat
- Any server implementing the OpenAI `/v1/audio/speech` endpoint

> **Note:** `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` is not required when using `openai-compat` provider.

### Voice Sidecar (Auto-Speak Responses)

The Voice Sidecar is a standalone WebSocket server that auto-speaks AI responses through ElevenLabs TTS (or any OpenAI-compatible TTS endpoint). It runs independently from the MCP router, so custom clients can publish speech payloads directly to the sidecar without routing through MCP tools.

**Setup:**

1. Ensure `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` is set in your `.env` file (required only when using the default `elevenlabs` provider)
2. Compile: `npx tsc`
3. Start the sidecar: `npm run voice` (or `npm run voice:dev` for development)
4. Register the voice hook in `~/.claude/settings.json`:
   ```json
   {
      "hooks": {
        "Stop": [
          {
            "command": "node /path/to/EVOKORE-MCP/scripts/voice-hook.js",
            "env": {
              "VOICE_SIDECAR_PERSONA": "orchestrator"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
   }
   ```

The sidecar listens on `ws://127.0.0.1:8888` by default (override with `VOICE_SIDECAR_PORT`, and use `VOICE_SIDECAR_HOST` on the hook side only if you need a non-default host). This `ws://127.0.0.1:<VOICE_SIDECAR_PORT>` endpoint is the standalone sidecar protocol endpoint for any custom producer. When Claude Code finishes a response, the bundled hook forwards the text to that endpoint and can now forward a persona as well, either from `VOICE_SIDECAR_PERSONA` or from a `persona` field carried in the payload metadata.

**Optional runtime controls:**

- `VOICE_SIDECAR_DISABLE_PLAYBACK=1` - skip local audio playback while keeping synthesis/stream handling intact; the sidecar logs that playback is disabled.
- `VOICE_SIDECAR_ARTIFACT_DIR=/absolute/path` - preserve a copy of the final playable `.mp3` in the specified directory and log the saved path.
- `VOICE_SIDECAR_PERSONA=orchestrator` - force the bundled hook to send that persona with every utterance.
- `VOICE_SIDECAR_HOST=127.0.0.1` - override the hook target host if you intentionally need something other than the loopback default.

These toggles are opt-in only; if unset, the sidecar preserves the existing playback behavior.

**Protocol contract (for custom integrations):**

Each WebSocket message is a JSON object with these fields:

- `text` (`string`): Text chunk to append to the current utterance buffer. Use `""` when sending a flush-only frame.
- `persona` (`string`, optional): Persona key from `voices.json` (`personas.<name>`). If omitted, the `default` voice config is used.
- `flush` (`boolean`, optional): When `true`, finalize buffered chunks and trigger synthesis/playback for the current utterance.

```json
{"text": "Hello world.", "persona": "orchestrator", "flush": true}
```

Or stream in chunks:
```json
{"text": "First part. ", "persona": "orchestrator"}
{"text": "Second part. "}
{"text": "", "flush": true}
```

Contract notes:

- `flush: true` can be sent with or without additional `text` in the same frame.
- `persona` may be sent on the first chunk, or repeated on each chunk for explicitness.
- Unknown personas fall back to `default` voice settings.
- The bundled `scripts/voice-hook.js` forwards `VOICE_SIDECAR_PERSONA` first, then falls back to any `persona` or `metadata.persona` field present in the hook payload.

### Persona Configuration

Edit `voices.json` in the project root to map agent roles to ElevenLabs voices. Each persona overrides fields from the `default` config:

```json
{
  "default": { "voiceId": "...", "model": "eleven_turbo_v2_5", "speed": 1.0, ... },
  "personas": {
    "orchestrator": { "voiceId": "...", "stability": 0.6 },
    "researcher": { "voiceId": "...", "speed": 1.1 }
  }
}
```

The sidecar re-reads `voices.json` on each new WebSocket connection (hot-reload), so persona/voice changes apply without restarting the sidecar process. Available default personas: `orchestrator`, `researcher`, `architect`, `implementer`, `tester`, `reviewer`.

### Speed and Prosody Tuning

Three layers of speed control, each stacking on the others:

| Layer | Method | Range | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| 1. API speed | `speed` in `voices.json` | 0.5 - 2.0 | Prosody-aware, best quality |
| 2. Model selection | `model` in `voices.json` | N/A | `eleven_turbo_v2_5` generates 3x faster |
| 3. Post-processing | `postProcessTempo` in `voices.json` | 1.0 - 4.0 | Requires `ffmpeg` on PATH; chains `atempo` filters |

Example for fast playback:
```json
{
  "speed": 1.2,
  "model": "eleven_turbo_v2_5",
  "postProcessTempo": 1.5
}
```

For natural-sounding fast speech, prefer Layer 1 (API speed) over Layer 3 (ffmpeg). Only use `postProcessTempo` for speeds beyond what the API supports.

Validation checks for this path:
- `npx vitest run test-voice-e2e-validation.js`
- `npx vitest run test-voice-refinement-validation.js`
- `npx vitest run test-voice-sidecar-smoke-validation.js`
- `npx vitest run test-voice-sidecar-hotreload-validation.js`

Opt-in live validation against ElevenLabs:

```bash
EVOKORE_RUN_LIVE_VOICE_TEST=1 ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_key_here npm run test:voice:live
```

The live test is intentionally excluded from `npm test`. It starts the compiled sidecar with playback disabled, captures an `.mp3` artifact into a temporary directory, sends a short websocket utterance with `flush: true`, and verifies the sidecar shuts down cleanly.

### Release Workflow

Safe npm publish is handled in GitHub Actions via `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

- Triggers: `v*.*.*` tags and `workflow_dispatch`
- Manual workflow guard: `workflow_dispatch` requires `chain_complete=true`
- Mainline safety gate: release commit must be an ancestor of `origin/main`
- Gates: `npm ci`, `npm test`, `npm run build`
- Publish guard: requires `NPM_TOKEN` secret
- Validation: `npm run release:check`, `npm run release:preflight`

Treat GitHub release publication and npm publication as separate gates: a GitHub release can succeed while npm publish is skipped.

### Cross-CLI Config Sync

Sync your EVOKORE-MCP registration across all supported AI CLIs:

```bash
# Preview what would change (recommended first)
npm run sync:dry

# Apply changes (writes files)
npm run sync

# Direct script usage defaults to DRY RUN
node scripts/sync-configs.js

# Explicitly write changes when running script directly
node scripts/sync-configs.js --apply

# Preserve existing evokore-mcp entries explicitly (default behavior)
node scripts/sync-configs.js --apply --preserve-existing

# Force overwrite existing evokore-mcp entries
node scripts/sync-configs.js --apply --force
```

**Supported CLIs:** Claude Code, Claude Desktop (Win/Mac/Linux), Cursor, Gemini CLI (prints manual command).

**Prerequisite:** You must build the project before running sync, because the script validates that `dist/index.js` exists:

```bash
npm run build
```

The sync script:
- Auto-detects installed CLIs
- Uses DRY RUN by default (or `--apply` to write changes)
- Preserves existing `evokore-mcp` entries by default (or `--force` to overwrite)
- Rejects conflicting flag pairs (`--dry-run` + `--apply`, `--force` + `--preserve-existing`)
- Only adds/updates the `evokore-mcp` server entry (never overwrites other servers)
- Resolves `dist/index.js` from the canonical repo root when run inside disposable git worktrees
- Target specific CLIs: `node scripts/sync-configs.js claude-code cursor` (dry run) or `node scripts/sync-configs.js --apply claude-code cursor` (write)

**Exit codes:**

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success (sync completed or dry-run previewed) |
| 1 | Error (conflicting flags, unknown target, or missing `dist/index.js`) |

**Troubleshooting:**

- **"dist/index.js not found"**: Run `npm run build` (or `npx tsc`) before syncing. The sync script requires the compiled entry point to exist.
- **Malformed target config**: If a CLI's config file contains invalid JSON, the sync script recovers gracefully by treating it as an empty config. The old file content will be replaced on `--apply`.
- **Cursor falls back to project-level config**: If `~/.cursor/mcp.json` does not exist, the script writes to `<PROJECT_ROOT>/.cursor/mcp.json` instead. Create the user-level file first if you prefer global Cursor configuration.
- **Gemini CLI shows "Not detected"**: The script checks for the `gemini` binary on PATH. Install Gemini CLI or run the printed `gemini mcp add` command manually.
- **Config not updating on re-run**: By default, `--preserve-existing` is active. If you need to overwrite a stale `evokore-mcp` entry, use `--force`.
- **Need to pin a different repo root**: Set `EVOKORE_SYNC_PROJECT_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/EVOKORE-MCP` before running the sync script.

## 8. Hook Observability

EVOKORE hook scripts emit structured JSONL events to:

- `~/.evokore/logs/hooks.jsonl`

Use this when validating hook behavior (damage-control, purpose-gate, session-replay, tilldone) without changing normal hook UX.

Event envelope fields:

- `ts`: ISO timestamp
- `hook`: hook identifier (`damage-control`, `purpose-gate`, `session-replay`, `tilldone`)
- `event`: hook-specific event name
- `session_id` (optional): sanitized session ID when available
- additional hook-specific metadata (for example `tool`, `reason`, `mode`, `incomplete_count`)

Common events:

- `damage-control`: `allow`, `ask`, `block`, `fail_open`
- `purpose-gate`: `state_initialized`, `purpose_recorded`, `purpose_reminder`, `fail_safe_error`
- `session-replay`: `replay_entry_written`, `fail_safe_error`
- `tilldone`: `hook_mode_block`, `hook_mode_allow`, `hook_mode_fail_safe`, `cli_action`, `cli_error`

Observability logging is best-effort and fail-safe: hook logging failures do not block hook execution paths.

### Log Rotation

`hooks.jsonl` is automatically rotated to prevent unbounded growth:

- **Threshold:** 5 MB per file
- **Rotation count:** Up to 3 rotated files (`hooks.jsonl.1`, `.2`, `.3`)
- **Trigger:** Checked before each write; when `hooks.jsonl` exceeds 5 MB, the current file is renamed to `.1`, existing `.1` shifts to `.2`, and `.2` to `.3`
- **Oldest file:** `.3` is overwritten on the next rotation cycle
- **Fail-safe:** Rotation errors are silently caught and never block hook execution

### Hook Log Viewer

View and filter hook events with the built-in viewer:

```bash
# Show last 50 events (default)
npm run hooks:view

# Filter by hook name
npm run hooks:view -- --hook damage-control

# Filter by date
npm run hooks:view -- --since 2025-02-26

# Filter by session ID (partial match)
npm run hooks:view -- --session abc123

# Show last 100 events
npm run hooks:view -- --tail 100

# Show all events (no tail limit)
npm run hooks:view -- --all

# Raw JSONL output (for piping)
npm run hooks:view -- --json

# Combine filters
npm run hooks:view -- --hook purpose-gate --since 2025-02-26 --tail 20
```

The viewer prints a formatted table with timestamps, hook names, event types, and session IDs, followed by summary statistics showing event counts by hook type.

PowerShell quick checks:

```powershell
# Tail recent hook events
Get-Content "$HOME\.evokore\logs\hooks.jsonl" -Tail 30

# Filter a specific hook with parsed JSON
Get-Content "$HOME\.evokore\logs\hooks.jsonl" |
  ForEach-Object { $_ | ConvertFrom-Json } |
  Where-Object { $_.hook -eq "damage-control" }
```

## 9. Platform Modules

EVOKORE-MCP includes a suite of platform modules that enable HTTP deployment, authentication, multi-tenancy, and extensibility. Each module is covered in detail in its own guide; this section provides a brief overview and cross-references.

### 9.1 HTTP Transport

EVOKORE-MCP can serve MCP over HTTP using the StreamableHTTP transport, enabling remote access, multi-client connections, and integration with load balancers and reverse proxies. Start in HTTP mode with `node dist/index.js --http` or `EVOKORE_HTTP_MODE=true`. The server exposes a `/health` endpoint for monitoring and `/mcp` for all MCP communication via JSON-RPC over HTTP with SSE streaming.

> **Detailed guide:** [HTTP_DEPLOYMENT.md](./HTTP_DEPLOYMENT.md)

### 9.2 Authentication and OAuth

HTTP transport endpoints can be protected with Bearer token authentication in two modes: a simple static shared secret for internal deployments, or JWT validation against a remote JWKS endpoint for production use with identity providers like Auth0 or Keycloak. Enable with `EVOKORE_AUTH_REQUIRED=true` and configure the mode via `EVOKORE_AUTH_MODE` (`static` or `jwt`).

> **Detailed guide:** [OAUTH_SETUP.md](./OAUTH_SETUP.md)

### 9.3 Session Isolation and Multi-Tenancy

In HTTP mode, each client connection receives a fully isolated session with its own tool activation state, rate limit counters, RBAC role, and metadata. Sessions are identified by UUID and managed with a configurable TTL (`EVOKORE_SESSION_TTL_MS`, default 1 hour). Expired sessions are cleaned periodically, and an LRU eviction policy caps the pool at 100 concurrent sessions.

> **Detailed guide:** [HTTP_DEPLOYMENT.md -- Session Lifecycle](./HTTP_DEPLOYMENT.md#session-lifecycle)

### 9.4 RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

EVOKORE supports three predefined roles -- `admin`, `developer`, and `readonly` -- defined in `permissions.yml`. Each role specifies a default permission level and per-tool overrides. When JWT authentication is active, the `role` claim from the token is threaded into the session and used by the `SecurityManager` for permission checks. Set `EVOKORE_ROLE` as a fallback when JWT is not in use.

> **Detailed guide:** [OAUTH_SETUP.md -- Role Claim Passthrough](./OAUTH_SETUP.md#role-claim-passthrough)

### 9.5 Rate Limiting

Configurable per-server and per-tool rate limits use a token bucket algorithm defined in `mcp.config.json` under each server's `rateLimit` block. Rate limit counters are scoped per-session in HTTP mode, so one client cannot exhaust another's quota. This mechanism is independent of the error-triggered cooldown that temporarily disables failing child servers.

> **Configuration details:** [Section 5 above](#5-rate-limiting)

### 9.6 Webhook Events

EVOKORE emits structured webhook events (tool calls, errors, session lifecycle, HITL approvals, plugin operations) to configured HTTP endpoints with HMAC-SHA256 signatures. Delivery is fire-and-forget with 3 retries and exponential backoff. Sensitive tool arguments are automatically redacted before emission. Enable with `EVOKORE_WEBHOOKS_ENABLED=true` and define subscriptions in the `webhooks` array of `mcp.config.json`.

> **Detailed guide:** [WEBHOOK_GUIDE.md](./WEBHOOK_GUIDE.md)

### 9.7 Plugin System

Plugins extend EVOKORE with custom tools and resources by placing `.js` files in the `plugins/` directory (configurable via `EVOKORE_PLUGINS_DIR`). Plugins are loaded at startup and can be hot-reloaded at runtime via the `reload_plugins` tool without restarting the server. Each plugin exports a manifest with `name`, optional `version`, and a `register(context)` function that uses the `PluginContext` API to register tools, resources, and emit webhook events.
