# STATUS (quick refresh)

## Repo Purpose
This repo captures a model-agnostic orchestration protocol. STATUS should record the current runtime and operational context.

## Handoff Ownership
- Current owner:
- Backup owner:

## Runtime Assumptions Checklist
- Local runtime available (or specified alternative).
- Repo in expected state (no unknown dirty changes).
- Required environment variables documented.

## Spec-First + Autonomy
- Spec-first checklist: `SPEC_FIRST_CHECKLIST.md`
- Autonomy budget template: `AUTONOMY_BUDGET.md`

## Runtime Protocols
- Harness initializer + clean-state protocol: `HARNESS_INITIALIZER.md`
- Progress log format + rotation: `PROGRESS_LOG_FORMAT.md`

## Agent Protocol
- Orchestrator edits: PLAN.md, TASKS.md, DECISIONS.md
- Workers take tasks, make branches, keep diffs small, run checks, update TASKS.

## Task Status Glossary
- queued: in TASKS queue, not started.
- in_progress: active work underway.
- blocked: waiting on a dependency or decision.
- review: awaiting reviewer input.
- done: verified and documented.

## Task Status Mapping
- queued -> in_progress: owner assigned and work started.
- in_progress -> review: risk triggers apply and review requested.
- in_progress -> done: no review required and evidence captured.
- review -> done: review outcomes resolved and evidence captured.
