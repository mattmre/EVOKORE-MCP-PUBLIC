## Inputs

- Agentic review framework or refinement report
- PR list and date range (explicit scope for the sweep)
- Current main branch state
- Master backlog file
- Active tracker pointer
- Backlog index and tracker index
- Test matrix
- Glossary

## Roles

- Orchestrator (primary owner, planning + triage)
- Specialist agents: Architecture, Security, Testing, Performance, Reliability/Debug, Documentation, UX
- Verification agent (optional, can be shared with Testing)

## Triggers

- Manual checkpoints
- End of major phase or roadmap milestone

## Severity Model

- Critical, High, Medium, Low
- Sorting: Severity first, then impact x (1/effort), then dependency order

## Workflow (ALIGN Phase)

1. **Scope lock**
   - Define PR range and time window.
   - Freeze inputs (refinement report + framework + PR list).

1a. **Retrospective input** _(optional but recommended before normalization)_
   - Run `session-retrospective-miner` for the time window matching this scope.
   - Provides: first-productive-turn baseline, clarification loop rates, work density, sessions without commits.
   - If narrative quality scores < 50/100 on relevant phase specs, update them before proceeding to EXECUTE.
   - Save retrospective report to `docs/session-logs/retro-[date].md` and attach as a supplemental input.
   - Skip this step if: scope is a bug-fix batch without phase specs, or no session data exists for the time window.

2. **Discovery + normalization**
   - Orchestrator ingests the review framework and the latest refinement report.
   - Normalize all findings into a single backlog with unique IDs.
   - De-duplicate, merge overlaps, and assign provisional severity.
   - Record backlog with date-stamped filename.

3. **Parallel re-validation**
   - Spawn specialist agents to re-validate findings against current main.
   - Each agent must attach exact file paths and line ranges.
   - Propose the smallest safe fix, acceptance criteria, and effort sizing (S/M/L).

4. **Architecture and planning synthesis**
   - Orchestrator merges validated findings into a master backlog.
   - Re-score and re-rank using the sorting model.
   - Identify dependency chains and blockers.

## Workflow (EXECUTE Phase)

5. **Tiered remediation execution**
   - Start with Critical, then High, Medium, Low.
   - For each tier, generate small, reviewable remediation PRs (one coherent theme per PR).
   - Do not advance to the next tier until current tier is empty or blocked with a written unblock plan.
   - If any item is marked blocked, elevate it to immediate priority for unblock planning.
   - Tier exit requires verification evidence logged for every item.
   - Tier close checklist (auditability):
     - All findings show verification evidence in tracker and cycle verification log.
     - Phase summaries exist for all PRs in the tier.
     - Risk memos (Critical/High) archived if merged and verified.

6. **Verification**
   - After each PR: run build and full relevant tests.
   - Capture commands and results in the tracker.
   - Mirror evidence in the cycle verification log.
   - Add logging/doc updates when required by the fix.

7. **Closure**
   - Post a concise phase summary after each PR: what closed, what remains, what is next.
   - Repeat until all tiers are remediated or formally deferred.

## Deliverables

- Master backlog
- Remediation PRs by tier
- Audit-grade tracker log
- Phase summaries

## Tracker Format (Required)

Required columns:
- finding-id
- severity
- owning-agent
- PR/branch
- status
- commit hash
- verification evidence (test command + result)
- verification-log entry id

## Backlog Entry Format

Each finding must include:
- finding-id
- title
- severity
- impact
- effort (S/M/L)
- file path + line range
- recommended minimal fix
- acceptance criteria
- dependencies (finding-ids)
- blockers

Dependency ordering:
- Use dependency lists to topologically order findings within the same severity tier.

## Concurrency Protocol

- Single editor per file at a time (backlog, tracker, change-log, verification-log).
- Each finding has one owning agent; only that agent edits its entry.
- If conflicts occur, prefer the version with newer verification evidence and merge manually.
- Parallel cycles are allowed only with separate backlog and tracker files.
- Use a current editor lock block for backlog and tracker files.

## Backlog Authority

- Each cycle has exactly one master backlog file referenced in the backlog index.

## Ownership Handoff

- If an owning agent is inactive for 2 sessions, reassign in change-log.
- Handoff requires a short note: status, next action, and last verification result.

## PR Theme Cohesion

- A PR should address a single root cause or tightly related cluster.
- If more than 3 findings are required, split by component or test boundary.

## Blocked Escalation

- If blocked persists for 2 sessions, escalate to Orchestrator + owner with a decision logged in change-log.

## Verification Evidence

- Required for every merged fix: command and outcome in tracker plus verification-log.
- If test selection is partial, record rationale and reference the test matrix.

## Dispute Resolution

- If severity or fix approach is disputed, Orchestrator decides with one neutral agent within 1 session.

## Definition of Done

- Finding has a merged PR or a documented defer/blocked entry with a scheduled follow-up.
- Tracker has evidence of test execution and results.
- Tier is empty or blocked with a written unblock plan.

## Guardrails

- Do not expand scope mid-cycle without re-locking the scope.
- Fixes must be minimal and safe; no refactors unless required by the fix.
- Each PR must be reviewable within one sitting.
- No tier skipping.
- Enforce commit message convention from `templates.md`.

## Enhancements (Research-Informed)

- Add explicit governance checkpoints: require human approval at scope lock, tier completion, and defer decisions.
- Use a lightweight change-management log for any scope change or defer (who/why/when).
- Treat post-merge review as a first-class step: require a remediation PR plan for any deviation from review guidelines.
- Track debt lifecycle states (new, validated, scheduled, in-progress, verified, deferred) to avoid limbo items.
- Capture a short risk memo for each Critical/High item to preserve context across sessions.
