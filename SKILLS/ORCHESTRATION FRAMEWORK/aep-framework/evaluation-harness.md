# Evaluation Harness

> Adapted from Agent33 ARCH-AEP evaluation harness for use as a portable orchestration skill.

Purpose: Define golden tasks, golden PR/issue cases, metrics, and an evaluation playbook for measuring orchestration quality and agent performance.

Related documents in this skill:
- `test-matrix.md` (test selection and partial run guidance)
- `verification-log.md` (verification evidence storage)
- `templates.md` (acceptance check patterns)

## Design Principles

1. **Model-Agnostic**: Tasks and metrics apply to any LLM or human agent.
2. **Repo-Agnostic**: Evaluation patterns are portable across projects.
3. **Deterministic**: Golden tasks have stable, verifiable expected outcomes.
4. **Evidence-Based**: Every evaluation run produces auditable artifacts.

## Golden Tasks

Golden tasks are reference scenarios with known expected outcomes. Use these to validate orchestration protocol adherence and agent behavior consistency.

### GT-01: Documentation-Only Task

**Description**: Create or update a markdown file with specified content structure.

**Input**:
- Task: "Add a glossary entry for 'golden task' to the project glossary"
- Constraints: No code changes, single file edit, minimal diff

**Expected Outcome**:
| Check | Pass Criteria |
|-------|---------------|
| File modified | Glossary file contains new entry |
| Entry format | Follows existing glossary term format |
| Diff size | < 20 lines added |
| Other files | No other files modified |

**Pass/Fail Criteria**:
- PASS: All checks satisfied; entry is accurate and formatted correctly.
- FAIL: Missing entry, incorrect format, extraneous changes, or wrong file.

### GT-02: Task Queue Update

**Description**: Add a new task to the task tracker following the minimum task payload template.

**Input**:

**Expected Outcome**:
| Check | Pass Criteria |
|-------|---------------|
| Task added | T99 appears in task queue section |
| Payload complete | ID, title, owner, acceptance criteria, verification steps present |
| Format correct | Matches existing task entry structure |
| No side effects | No changes outside task tracker |

**Pass/Fail Criteria**:
- PASS: Task entry is complete, correctly formatted, and placed in queue.
- FAIL: Missing fields, incorrect format, or unrelated changes.

### GT-03: Cross-Reference Validation

**Description**: Verify and fix broken cross-references between documents.

**Input**:
- Task: "Audit the orchestrator README for broken links and fix any found"
- Constraints: Report findings, fix only confirmed broken links

**Expected Outcome**:

## Golden PR/Issue Cases

Golden PR/issue cases validate review quality, diff assessment, and acceptance check enforcement.

## Metrics Definitions

### M-01: Success Rate

**Definition**: Percentage of tasks that meet all acceptance criteria on first attempt.

**Formula**: `(tasks_passed_first_attempt / total_tasks_attempted) * 100`

**Measurement**:
- Count tasks where all acceptance checks pass without revision.
- Exclude tasks blocked by external dependencies.

**Target Baseline**: Establish initial baseline; track trend over time.

**Evidence Source**: Task tracker status, session logs, verification-log entries.

---

### M-02: Time-to-Green

**Definition**: Elapsed time from task start to all acceptance criteria passing.

**Formula**: `task_completion_timestamp - task_start_timestamp`

**Measurement**:
- Record start time when task moves to "In Progress".
- Record completion time when task moves to "Done" with passing verification.
- Exclude blocked time if documented.

**Target Baseline**: Establish per-task-type baselines (small/medium/large).

**Evidence Source**: Task tracker timestamps, session log timestamps.

---

### M-03: Rework Rate

**Definition**: Percentage of tasks requiring revision after initial completion attempt.

**Formula**: `(tasks_requiring_rework / total_tasks_completed) * 100`

**Measurement**:
- Count tasks where reviewer feedback required changes.
- Count tasks where acceptance criteria failed on first verification.

**Target Baseline**: Lower is better; track trend over time.

**Evidence Source**: Review capture entries, task tracker revision history.

---

### M-04: Diff Size

**Definition**: Total lines changed (added + removed) per task or PR.

**Formula**: `lines_added + lines_removed`

**Measurement**:
- Capture from git diff or PR summary.
- Record in evidence capture diff summary section.

**Target Baseline**: Smaller is generally better for focused tasks; establish per-task-type norms.

**Evidence Source**: Evidence capture diff summary, git log.

---

### M-05: Scope Adherence

**Definition**: Percentage of tasks completed without scope violations or creep.

**Formula**: `(tasks_within_scope / total_tasks_attempted) * 100`

**Measurement**:
- Count tasks where no files outside scope were modified.
- Count tasks where no escalation for scope violation occurred.

**Target Baseline**: 100% is ideal; track violations as improvement opportunities.

**Evidence Source**: Task tracker, session logs, decisions log escalations.

## Evaluation Playbook

### Step 1: Prepare Evaluation Environment

1. Confirm clean repository state (no uncommitted changes).
2. Record environment details:
   - Repository path
   - Branch name
   - Commit hash (HEAD)
   - Date and time
3. Create evaluation session log.

### Step 2: Select Golden Tasks

1. Choose golden tasks to run based on evaluation goals:
   - Full regression: Run all GT-01 through GT-07.
   - Targeted validation: Select specific tasks (e.g., GT-05 for scope enforcement).
2. Record selected tasks in session log.

### Step 3: Execute Golden Tasks

For each selected golden task:

1. Read the task input and constraints.
2. Execute the task following standard orchestration protocol.
3. Capture evidence using the evidence capture template.
4. Record pass/fail against each check in the expected outcome table.
5. Note any deviations or unexpected behaviors.

### Step 4: Execute Golden PR/Issue Cases (if applicable)

For each selected golden case:

1. Create or simulate the PR scenario.
2. Perform acceptance checks as documented.
3. Record assessment results.
4. Compare to expected results in the case definition.

### Step 5: Capture Baseline Metrics

1. Calculate metrics M-01 through M-05 for the evaluation run.
2. Record in the evaluation session log:
   ```
   ## Baseline Metrics
   - Success Rate (M-01): X%
   - Time-to-Green (M-02): [per-task times]
   - Rework Rate (M-03): X%
   - Diff Size (M-04): [per-task sizes]
   - Scope Adherence (M-05): X%
   ```

### Step 6: Generate Evaluation Report

1. Summarize pass/fail counts for golden tasks.
2. Summarize acceptance check results for golden cases.
3. Document any anomalies or improvement opportunities.
4. Store report in session log and reference from verification-log.

### Step 7: Archive Artifacts

1. Commit evaluation session log.
2. Update verification-log with evaluation entry:
   ```
   - YYYY-MM-DD - eval-<run-id> - <branch> - golden task evaluation - X/Y passed - see session log
   ```
3. Store any generated artifacts in documented location.

## Baseline Run Protocol

Before any optimization or change to orchestration protocols:

1. **Record Current State**: Document the orchestration version/commit being evaluated.
2. **Run Full Golden Suite**: Execute all GT-01 through GT-07 and GC-01 through GC-04.
3. **Capture All Metrics**: Record M-01 through M-05.
4. **Store as Baseline**: Mark this evaluation run as the baseline in the session log header.
5. **Reference in Changes**: Any subsequent change to orchestration should reference this baseline and show delta.
