# RULES.md -- EVOKORE-MCP Declarative Security Policies

> This document declares **policy intent**. Runtime enforcement lives in `damage-control-rules.yaml`, `permissions.yml`, and the hook scripts under `scripts/hooks/`. RULES.md is the human-readable "why"; the YAML/JS files are the machine-readable "how."
>
> If RULES.md and a runtime rule disagree, the runtime rule wins for *this* invocation, and the discrepancy is a bug to file. Policy drift is a failure mode.

## 1. File Access Policies

File access is tiered. Every path on disk falls into exactly one access class.

### Zero-Access (blocked for read and write)

These paths must never be read, written, or traversed by any tool invocation. Damage-control blocks them at the PreToolUse hook.

- `.env`, `.env.*` (except `.env.example`) -- contains runtime secrets
- `.git/config`, `.git/credentials` -- contains git authentication state
- `*.pem`, `*.key`, `id_rsa`, `id_ed25519` -- private keys of any kind
- `~/.aws/credentials`, `~/.ssh/id_*` -- external credential stores
- Any path matching `*secret*`, `*credential*`, `*token*` under user home unless explicitly allowlisted

**Intent:** Secret leakage is irreversible. A secret read into context has already been compromised. Zero-access is enforced at the hook layer because no tool-level check is trustworthy enough.

### Read-Only (reads allowed, writes blocked)

- `damage-control-rules.yaml` -- runtime policy source (edit requires explicit workflow)
- `permissions.yml` -- RBAC role definitions (edit requires explicit workflow)
- `.claude/settings.json` -- hook wiring (edit requires explicit workflow)
- `mcp.config.json` -- proxy and webhook configuration (edit requires explicit workflow)
- `package-lock.json` -- dependency lock file (modified only by `npm install`)

**Intent:** These files are the control plane. Editing them mid-session without explicit purpose is how configuration drift becomes silent regression. A dedicated workflow for each edit forces the operator to declare intent.

### Write-Allowed (reads and writes permitted)

- `src/**` -- TypeScript source files
- `tests/**` -- vitest test files
- `docs/**` -- documentation and research notes
- `scripts/**` (excluding `scripts/hooks/` core files) -- operational scripts
- `SKILLS/**` -- skill markdown files (respecting submodule boundaries)
- `.claude/worktrees/**` -- ephemeral agent worktrees

**Intent:** These are the normal work surfaces. Writes here are expected, captured by evidence-capture, and reviewable through the PR flow.

### Append-Only (writes allowed, edits discouraged)

- `~/.evokore/sessions/*-replay.jsonl` -- session replay log
- `~/.evokore/sessions/*-evidence.jsonl` -- evidence capture log
- `~/.evokore/logs/*.log` -- hook runtime logs

**Intent:** Historical records lose their value if they can be silently rewritten. These files are intended to be appended to and rotated, never edited in place.

## 2. Tool Restrictions

Tool access is tiered by trust and reversibility. Tier assignments are enforced by `permissions.yml` (RBAC) and the HITL approval token system.

### Always-Allow (no approval required)

- Read-only skill resolution: `discover_tools`, `resolve_workflow`, `search_skills`, `get_skill_help`, `list_registry`
- Read-only session analytics: `session_context_health`, `session_analyze_replay`, `session_work_ratio`
- Navigation: `nav_get_map`, `nav_read_anchor`
- Telemetry inspection: `get_telemetry`
- Status queries: `proxy_server_status`
- Any MCP tool annotated with `readOnlyHint: true`

**Intent:** Observability is never a security risk. An operator needs to see what is happening before they can make a safe decision about what to do next.

### Require-Approval (HITL token required)

- Tools that mutate persistent state: Edit, Write, Bash (for state-changing commands)
- Tools that spend external credits or send external traffic: LLM calls, remote fetches
- Tools marked `destructiveHint: true` or `openWorldHint: true` without an explicit allowlist
- Proxied supabase mutation tools (per `mcp.config.json` tiered permissions)

**Intent:** Every mutation should cross a human-judgment checkpoint at least once per session. The HITL approval token ensures the operator actively authorized the class of action, not merely that the agent decided it was a good idea.

### Deny (blocked unconditionally)

- Tools that would exfiltrate secrets: any Bash command matching `.env`, credential paths, or private key globs
- Tools that would bypass enforcement: `git commit --no-verify`, `git push --force origin main`
- Tools that would corrupt history: `git reset --hard origin/main` when the working tree is dirty, `git clean -f` without explicit scope
- Tools that match damage-control fork-bomb, rm-rf, or recursive-delete patterns

**Intent:** Some actions have no legitimate agent use case. Deny-list tools are reserved for explicit operator-initiated recovery workflows, never for routine agent execution.

## 3. Commit Policies

All commits to this repository must satisfy the following policies.

- **Conventional commits required.** Every commit message follows the `type(scope): subject` format. Valid types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`, `perf`, `build`. Scope is optional but encouraged. Commitlint enforcement is wired in CI.

- **No `--no-verify`.** Hooks are the last line of defense. Skipping them because one is in a hurry is how silent regressions land. If a hook is misfiring, fix the hook -- do not bypass it.

- **No force push to main or master.** `git push --force origin main` is unconditionally denied. Force push to feature branches is allowed only when the operator explicitly requests it and the branch has no open PR under active review.

- **PR template enforced.** Every PR must satisfy the sections in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`: `## Description`, `## Type of Change`, `## Testing`, `## Evidence`. `validate-pr-metadata.js` checks this in CI.

- **Sequential merges for shared-surface changes.** When a PR touches hook scripts, CLAUDE.md, `.claude/settings.json`, validation scripts, or control-plane files, the next PR must be rebased onto the updated main and its CI must pass fresh before merging. No batch merges on shared surfaces.

- **Use `.commit-msg.txt` + `-F`.** Commit messages are drafted in `.commit-msg.txt` and passed to `git commit -F .commit-msg.txt`. Heredocs and inline `-m` strings can false-positive damage-control on complex command strings.

- **New commits, not amends.** When a pre-commit hook fails, the commit did not happen -- `--amend` would modify the *previous* commit, potentially destroying previous work. Fix the issue, re-stage, and create a new commit.

**Intent:** Commit hygiene is how history stays trustworthy. A git log that follows conventional commits can generate changelogs automatically. A git log with bypassed hooks cannot be trusted to reflect what is actually in the working tree.

## 4. Session Policies

Every focused work block is a session, with its own manifest at `~/.evokore/sessions/{sessionId}.json`.

- **Purpose required on session start.** The `purpose-gate` hook asks for session intent on the first user prompt and refuses to proceed without one. Purpose is injected into every subsequent prompt via `additionalContext` so the agent cannot drift silently.

- **Evidence capture always enabled.** The `evidence-capture` hook writes test results, file changes, and git operations to the session evidence JSONL. This is not optional. Evidence is how future sessions reconstruct what happened.

- **Replay logging always active.** The `session-replay` hook writes every tool invocation to the session replay JSONL. This is not optional. Replay is how regressions are debugged.

- **Till-done gate before session stop.** The `tilldone` hook blocks session Stop events while incomplete tasks remain in `~/.evokore/sessions/{sessionId}-tasks.json`. Tasks are completed via `node scripts/tilldone.js --done <N>` or explicitly cleared with `--clear`.

- **Session manifest is the source of truth.** Agents read purpose, task state, and continuity health from the session manifest -- not from inferred context. Guessing session state is an anti-pattern (see SOUL.md section 5).

- **One session, one purpose.** Multi-purpose sessions produce context rot. If the scope changes, the current session is closed via `tilldone` and a new session is opened with a fresh purpose declaration.

**Intent:** Session discipline is what keeps work focused, auditable, and recoverable. A session without purpose, evidence, and replay is indistinguishable from random tool calls.

## 5. Escalation Policies

Some actions require human approval beyond the default HITL token flow. These escalations are routed through explicit operator prompts.

- **Destructive git operations.** Force push (to any branch), `git reset --hard`, `git branch -D`, worktree removal with uncommitted state, and submodule reset all require explicit operator confirmation. The operator sees the exact command and states before approving.

- **`.env` or credential file access.** Any tool invocation that resolves to a `.env` path, credential file, or private key is denied at damage-control and requires operator intervention to unblock. Even *reading* these paths requires explicit scoped approval.

- **Force push to main or master.** Unconditionally denied regardless of operator approval. This is not an escalation path -- it is a hard block. If history rewriting on main is required, the operator performs it manually with a documented runbook.

- **Schema or configuration changes.** Edits to `mcp.config.json`, `permissions.yml`, `damage-control-rules.yaml`, `.claude/settings.json`, and database schemas require explicit operator approval. These files are the control plane; silent edits produce policy drift.

- **Release operations.** Publishing to npm, tagging a release, and creating a GitHub release all require explicit operator approval. `release:preflight` must pass; `NPM_TOKEN` presence must be verified.

- **Cross-session artifact writes.** Writing to shared trackers (orchestration trackers, session logs, handoff notes) from inside an agent worktree requires explicit operator approval. Shared trackers are updated on main, not on feature branches.

- **External network calls from agents.** An agent invoking a webhook, remote fetch, or external LLM call spends real resources and emits real network traffic. These are escalated through the HITL token flow and logged as evidence.

**Intent:** Escalation is how the system refuses to trade speed for safety. Every escalated action has a human who said "yes" for a reason that is preserved in the session manifest and evidence log.

*If a runtime rule conflicts with RULES.md, the runtime wins for that invocation. File a bug; fix the drift; keep the two in sync.*
